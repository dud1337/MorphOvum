## About
Morph Ovum is a free and open source community radio service.

* HTTP streams your radio's audio
* No sound card and no desktop environment required
* 3 audio sources (*all optional*):
  * Music (*e.g. smooth jazz*)
  * Ambience (*e.g. distant thunderstorms*)
  * Clips: Approximately every n minutes, play an audio clip (*e.g. "you're listening to morph ovum!"*)
* Provides a [Flash-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)-based API for real-time control
* Provides a websocket for frontends to avoid polling
* Plays anything [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) can play:
  * Your personal library
  * An [airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic) playlist
  * An internet radio station
  * YouTube videos (Sometimes there's an arms race and VLC can't)
  * ...


## TL;DR: Quickstart Guide
0. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file similar to
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
    morphovum:
        image: dud1337/morphovum
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        ports:
            - '8138:8138'
            - '8139:8139'
            - '8140:8140'
#       volumes:
#           - /path/to/your/music:/fm/music
#           - /path/to/your/ambience:/fm/ambience
#           - /path/to/your/clips:/fm/clips
#           - /path/to/your/playlists:/fm/playlists
#           - /path/to/your/config_dir:/fm/conf
        environment:
        	- MORPH_OVUM_PASSWORD=changeme	# not used if config_dir is given
        	- TZ="Europe/Zurich"
```
1. To start your Morph Ovum server run
```
docker-compose up
```
2. To listen play `http://127.0.0.1:8138` in your preferred media player
```
mpv http://127.0.0.1:8138
```
3. To check the current music track
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8139/api/music/current/track
{"msg": "ok!", "data": "Krangu - Scratchy Funk"}
```
4. To check the current ambience playlist
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8139/api/ambience/current/playlist
{"msg": "ok!", "data": ["ambience/icmusic__thunderstorm_short.mp3", "ambience/lurpsis__lit_fireplace.mp3"]}
```
5. To log in as admin with the default password
```
printf 'changeme' | sha256sum
057ba03d6c44104863dc7361fe4578965d1887360f90a0895882e58a6248fc86  -
curl http://127.0.0.1/admin
{"msg": "you are not admin", "data": false}
curl -c /tmp/morphovum_cookie_test -d "password_hash=057ba03d6c44104863dc7361fe4578965d1887360f90a0895882e58a6248fc86" http://127.0.0.1:8139/api/admin
{"msg": "ok!"}
curl -b /tmp/morphovum_cookie_test http://127.0.0.1:8139/api/admin
{"msg": "ok! you are admin", "data": true}
```
6. To immediately play a YouTube link
```
curl -b /tmp/cookie http://127.0.0.1:8139/api/music/wp/ -d "url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3fv=rquygdjf0d8"
{"msg": "ok! music playing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rquygdjf0d8"}
```


## Admin Functionality
**Docker docker-compose.yaml**
```
    environment:
      - MORPH_OVUM_PASSWORD=changeme
```
**Python config.yaml**
```yaml
# 1. Administration.
# admin_password: Sets password for admin commands
# 
admin_password: changeme
```

To create an admin session the user sends a POST request to /admin resource on the API is sent with the SHA256 
hash of the set password. See the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) and [Quickstart Guide](#tldr-quickstart-guide) for usage details.


## Media Directories

      - /path/to/your/clips:/fm/clips
      - /path/to/your/playlists:/fm/playlists
```
**Python config.yaml**
```
audio_dirs:
  music     : /path/to/your/music
